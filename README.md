# DigitalOcean Load Balancer using Terraform

## Description
A personal sandbox-ish repo for me to better understand [IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) using [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) together with [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) as my provider (over other resources like AWS).
This project allows you to provision 2 droplets behind 1 load balancer and gives you a domain (which you can modify yourself).
